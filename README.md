# Curse Mania

Curse Mania is a Rhythm game embedded entirely in a terminal window using the Python ncurses library wrapper. You can both play maps and create new ones!

## How to Install

Clone this repository using
  git clone https://github.com/mknyszek/curse-mania.git

Then, start the game by typing
  ./cmania
in the repository's root.

In order to fully enjoy the game, you need pyaudio installed in your Python distribution. One can do this through pip:

## How to Play

Before you start playing, you need to add songs. To do this, simply convert your music to .wav format, and copy it into music/wav.

Now, start the game.

To navigate menus, simply follow on-screen instructions.

First, you probably want to create a few maps to play on. Go ahead and enter record mode, choose your song, and start recording the steps to your song! The currently supported keys are d, f, j, and k.

Now, enter play mode, and play the game as you would play!
